A Dynamic Web Application Project üíªüë©‚Äçüíª Using (Servlet, JSP, JDBC, Mysql, Eclipse IDE) to control both
the frontend and backend operation on the Web Application

- JSP: in this project, Jsp typically served as the HTML & CSS style page with some front-end functions.
making the web application more flexible and user friendly for this purpose to meet the client needs.

- Servlet: Servlet is a typical java class, Hence in this project it served as the Backend-end
operation where I was able to connect the web Application with MySQL using JDBC, in other to
store the clients data. Servlet also served as a backend-end security function on the web application.

- JDBC: This a very important tool in the project, it served as a connector in between Mysql database
and Java Servlet where i was able to connect the web application with the databases to fetch and store
User information with the help of mysql-connector-j-8.0.33

- MYSQL: This is a database storage, where all information entered into the Web Appplication by the Users
are stored for future reference.

In addition, i was also able to create a forget password function using Servlet and JSP
where the client will be redirect to a new page to input their information (email) in other
to retrieve back their account by reiceving an otp code then resseting a new password.
